		<h2>What Tudor and Andrei say </h2>
		
		<p>Tudor is a young man who often flew with Tarom and, like any Romanian, pays monthly taxes from which the state offered the company a restructuring loan of 36.7 million euros. If clear measures are not taken, not all the money in the world could save Tarom from bankruptcy, says Andrei, a 10-year-old Tarom pilot.
    Since working in the company, he has not caught a single year in which Tarom is not at a loss.</p>
    <p>"We know the history of the company, we know that in the last 10 years it has not been profitable. Several directors have changed management, none of whom have managed to leave their mark or restructure the company. We have to ask ourselves what will be the solution? A capital injection with money from the budget or an efficient restructuring ", said Tudor, a Tarom client.</p>
    <p>"In 2004, Tarom had $ 800 million in its accounts, and now we have nothing. As long as you throw money out the window paying some contracts over the value you should pay, your (profit) margin becomes zero ", says Andrei Rusu, a 10-year-old pilot at Tarom.</p>
    <p>"If you ask me how to relaunch Tarom: first of all it would be a manager with experience in the field of aviation, who should be allowed to cut harmful contracts and be left long enough to carry out his management plan. good end. ”, said the pilot Andrei Rusu.</p>
