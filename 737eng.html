		<h2>Blue Air dropped order of 6 737 MAX ordered directly from Boeing to supplement the net for Air Lease Corporation </h2>

		<p>Blue Air has announced that it will cancel the order for 6 737 MAX 8 aircraft directly from Boeing but will supplement the one from Air Lease Corporation from 6 to 10 aircraft.
Both orders were placed in 2017</p>
		
		</article>
		<article class="post">
			<h2> The difference between the commands</h2>
			<p> The difference between the two agreements is important. The contract with Boeing, which Blue Air gave up, was one for the purchase of aircraft, therefore very expensive for the level of a local low-cost operator.
The one with Air Lease Corporation is a long-term lease, much more advantageous in terms of payments to be made.</p>

			<article class="post">
			<h2> What has happened since 2017 and so far with the orders? </h2>
			<p> Orders have undergone many changes since 2017, when they were placed. Each order was 6 aircraft.
At the end of 2019, the company's flight magazine stated that Blue Air would receive only eight Boeing 737 MAXs, not 12 as ordered in 2017. Below is a photo: </p>

			<p> MAXs ordered from Air Lease Corporation were scheduled to be delivered before those ordered directly from Boeing
and the first plane has already been painted and is currently parked at Moses Lake Airport in the United States. The company expects the first MAX to arrive in Bucharest in October of this year, according to Oana Petrescu, CEO of Blue Air. </p>

		<p>Production of the 737 began in 1966. Since then, some airlines have withdrawn their older aircraft, others have kept them for a number of reasons (financial, reliability, etc.). But at the moment what are the oldest 737s in operation? Let's find out.</p>

		<h2> The oldest 737 still flying</h2>
		<img class="picture" src="Aer lingus 737 200.png" alt="Aer Lingus 737-200">
		<p>The oldest aircraft are the FAP-353 and FAP354 (737-200 and over 50 years old) which have a long history. Both initially flew for Aer Lingus (from 1969 to 1970). Aer lingus then leased these aircraft to airlines, including Air Algiere, Zambia Airlines, Nigeria Airlines and Bahamsaair, among others. After several years of passenger service with a now-defunct Peruvian airline, they joined the Peruvian Air Force.</p>
