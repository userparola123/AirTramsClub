		<h2>Despre noi</h2>
    
		<img class="picture" src="aboutusimage.jpg" alt="AirTramsClub">
		<p> AirTramsClub is a mini-website that wants to bring interesting, good quality news with videos and explanations. </p>
<p> The AirTramsClub "team" is made up of a family with a child who is extremely passionate about airplanes and trams. Actually, that's why I made the website :) </p>
<p> My family has supported me and continues to support me in my passion, which is why I consider them part of the AirTramsClub team. </p>
    <p> If you're wondering where I learned how to make websites? Simple. There had been an ad on Facebook that read, "We teach you to make amazing websites without knowledge." That site was called <a href="https://codeberryschool.com/ro/landing-ro/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ro&utm_term=codeberry&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0YD4BRD2ARIsAHwmKVmw4g2WvnQZPNmhnBocT_LSiiAe-WjefANpSzb_YJAeD5XsWttct10aAtOwEALw_wcB">CodeBerry School</a>. Si asa in 3 luni (adica din 20 martie 2020 pana in 20 iunie 2020) am invatat sa fac site-uri web uimitoare. Intr-adevar. Si din 20 iunie pana in 4 iulie 2020 am lucrat din greu sa termin acest site web. Si chiar am terminat:). In 5 iulie 2020 website-ul AirTramsClub a fost publicat pe internet. </p>

		<h2> How is the website </h2>

  
<p> CodeBerry teaches you how to make one-page websites, but it's 18. It wasn't a problem because I was able to successfully query the CodeBerry community on Slack. If you are wondering "why he deleted the news the day before and now wrote a new one" the answer is: </p>

  <p> This site has just been published, will be improved over time, and CodeBerry <strong> doesn't even teach you how to make very complicated news sites </strong>. They teach you <strong> just the basics </strong>. Anyway, years will pass and I will probably get there too;) </p>

<p> We hope you like the website and that you will get your daily dose of information from here :))))))) </p>
