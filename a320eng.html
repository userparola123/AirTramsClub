  <p> Production of the A320 began in 1988. Since then, some airlines have withdrawn their older aircraft, others have retained them for a number of reasons 
   (financial, reliability, etc.). But at the moment what are the oldest A320s in operation? Let's find out. </p>

		<h2>Lufthansa is next in the rankings </h2>
		<img class="picture" src="d-aipp-lufthansa-airbus-a320-211_.jpg" alt="Lufthansa D-AIPP">
		<p>Lufthansa also has fairly old aircraft. D-AIPP is an A320-211 and is 30 years old. Most likely the aircraft will be withdrawn because Lufthansa has major financial problems due to Covid-19. 
    Many old A320 aircraft are continuously withdrawn and stored in Teruel, Spain. With only a few days younger than D-AIPP, D-AIPR and D-AIPS are withdrawn to Schonefeld.</p>
