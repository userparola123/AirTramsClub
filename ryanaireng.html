		<p> Ryanair announced in a statement on Friday that it would challenge the decision of a Hungarian court,
taken at the request of rival carrier Wizz Air to block the operation of Buzz in Hungary,
which is a subsidiary of the Irish air carrier, using its own Buzz brand on the Hungarian market. </p>
<p> For the past 17 years, the Buzz brand has been in the Ryanair group. </p>

		<h2>History of Ryanair</h2>

		<p> Ryanair also had a history, of course. At times the company has had difficult times, at other times it has prospered,
    becoming the largest low-cost carrier in Europe in 2020 and not needing any financial help from the Irish government. 
    If you can believe it, it has a fleet of 432 Boeing 737-800 and a 737-700, used for pilot training. </ P>

		<h2>1986-1989: A great expansion</h2>
		<img class="picture" src="atr ryanair.png" alt="ATR 43-300">
  <caption> With the great expansion of 1986-1989, Ryanair introduced an ATR 43-300 in its fleet </caption>
<p> During this period they introduced new routes and took an ATR 43-300 in the fleet. With this modernization, Ryanair removed from the fleet the EMB 110 Bandeirante bomber (the first aircraft). 
In 1990 Ryanair had 600,000 passengers. With these many investments, Ryanair began to lose money. </p>

		<h2>The big change </h2>
		<img class="picture" src="rynair 737 200.png" alt="Ryanair 737-200">
		<p>In 1994 Ryanair <strong> removed all 3 aircraft from its fleet </strong> and the 737 era began. Initially, Boeing 737-200s joined the fleet. Since then, Ryanair has been a success. In 1995 they had 2.25 million passengers. It wasn't until 1999 that Ryanair began buying the too-usual 737-800 (NG-Next Generation). </p>
