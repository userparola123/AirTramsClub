		<h2> The world's largest fleet of Boeing 747 aircraft will be taken out of service immediately</h2>
    <i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> 17 iulie 2020

		<p> British Airways has announced that it will decommission its entire fleet of Boeing 747 aircraft,
due to declining activity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, informs <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53426886"> BBC </a>. </p>
<p> The British company is the largest 747 aircraft operator in the world, with 31 pieces in its fleet. </p>
"We are saddened to announce the immediate withdrawal of the entire Boeing 747 fleet," a British Airways spokesman told the BBC. </p>
<p> Airlines around the world have been severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic and traffic restrictions introduced by countries. </p>
"It is unlikely that 747s will ever fly commercial flights to British Airways again due to low demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic," the BA official added. </p>
British Airways, owned by International Airlines Group (IAG), has announced that the planes will be withdrawn immediately. Boeing 747 aircraft account for 10% of the BA fleet. </p>
<p> The company had originally planned to withdraw them in 2024, but has postponed the date due to declining demand. </p>
<p> British Airways' predecessor, BOAC, began operating Boeing 747s in the 1970s. </p>
<p> After the elimination of 747 aircraft, BA will operate several flights on more modern aircraft such as the Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner. </p>
<p> Boeing 747 aircraft contributed to the popularization of commercial flights in the 1970s, celebrating 50 years of activity in February 2019. The American company Boeing announced that it would stop production of 747s a year ago </p>

		<p>Painting an airplane requires up to 13 days of well-organized work, according to Airlinestravel. The plane is first given a light color and then it is actually painted.
